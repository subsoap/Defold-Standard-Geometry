# Defold Standard Geometry
A set of 3D .dae models prepared for use with Defold.

Also includes basic material shaders.

The source modules are produced with the free modeling software Wings3D http://www.wings3d.com/

Meters are the basic unit in Defold. 1 pixel in default orthographic view is equal to 1 meter so for 3d scenes you will need to zoom in much more. You can, of course, scale your assets how you want them to be.

If you are a 3d modeler and would like to contribute improved or additional models please do.

Use ctrl/alt to pan, rotate and mouse wheel to zoom in views.
